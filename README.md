# Lab 1: Design 4-bit binary Adder-Subtractor and ALU
 Due Date: Due by October 14, 2022

**Please submit the lab in the format mentioned below.**

## Submission instructions
There are two main parts in lab-1: 1) Designing a 4-bit adder/subtractor; 2) Designing a 4-bit ALU.

### Folders Structure
There are following 2 folders in the main folder ("EC311_Lab1_Template"):
  - (1) "add_sub_4_bit"
  - (2) "alu_4_bit"
  
You will place the solution code for part-1 of lab-1, i.e., the 4-bit binary adder-subtractor in the folder named "add_sub_4_bit/hdl", and the solution code for part-2 of lab-1, i.e., the 4-bit Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) in the folder named "alu_4_bit/hdl".

### Lab-1 Part-1 Folder Structure & Signal Naming
The main solution code for the part-1 of lab-1 should be inside the file "add_sub_4_bit.v" in the following path:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/add_sub_4_bit/hdl/add_sub_4_bit.v*
- Verilog files of other modules that are being instantiated in the top module "add_sub_4_bit.v" should also be present in the following path: *EC311_Lab1_Template/add_sub_4_bit/hdl/*
- Do not change the names of the input/output ports or the module name for your top file.

Upload your testbench files here:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/add_sub_4_bit/tb*

### Lab-1 Part-2 Folder Structure & Signal Naming
The main solution verilog code for the part-2 of lab-1 should be inside the file "alu_4_bit.v" in the following path:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/alu_4_bit/hdl/alu_4_bit.v*
- Verilog files of other modules that are being instantiated in the top module "alu_4_bit.v" should also be present in the following path: *EC311_Lab1_Template/alu_4_bit/hdl/*
- Do not change the names of the input/output ports or the module name for your top file.

Upload your testbench files here:
- *EC311_Lab1_Template/alu_4_bit/tb*

## Change the YML file inside EC311_Lab1_Template/.github/workflows/classroom.yml

Do the following steps so that your code can be graded:
 - Copy the entire contents of the file *EC311_Lab1_Template/.github/workflows/copy_to_classroom.yml* and paste it to the file **EC311_Lab1_Template/.github/workflows/classroom.yml** (remove the entire contents of classroom.yml first)
